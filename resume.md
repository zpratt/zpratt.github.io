Acted as the driving force behind organization-wide transformation from unpredictable project and individual-focused delivery to a journey towards predictable product and quality-focused teams. I defined critical roles such as engineers and product owners and hired many individuals into key positions. Beyond organization transformation, I focused on the adoption of XP, DevOps, Systems, and Security Modernization. Key accomplishments included:

This involves mentoring and coaching over 35 developers across 5 scrum teams from the U.S., Canada, and India in all facets of software engineering and XP practices. We have successfully deployed this application to the entire Australia/New Zealand region in production. Under my leadership, we transformed a struggling implementation with chronic issues to a reliable delivery pipeline where we successfully deploy changes to production every day.

**Senior UI Developer - Deere & Company (Nov 2013 - May 2015):**

As a senior developer on the advanced UI team, I helped lead the implementation and adoption of advanced frameworks and shared UI components for multiple customer facing applications. This required me to work with many different teams and to collaboratively develop a strategy of mentoring and sharing of knowledge about our components and underlying frameworks. Additionally, I worked closely with our UX experts and designers to define the user experience for MyJohnDeere.

**Developer - Deere & Company (April 2012 - Nov 2013):**

As a member of the master data team within the Information Knowledge Center, I was the lead developer for the location master data repository as well as the tech lead for the Application Data Maintenance System (ADMS). In this position, I focused on building application systems to maintain data, data integration, and adoption of master data by many different business units within the company.

**Systems Engineer - Western Illinois University (May 2006 - March 2012):**

I conceived of, architected, and managed the implementation of a business analytics system for the entire university. I was also a developer and system administrator tasked with building a web-based teacher accreditation system for COEHS. Additionally, I was a senior member of the web accessibility committee and helped develop and maintain several web sites, both public facing and internal facing.
